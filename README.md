# Weather forecast app

This android app uses Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) meaning that it is designed to be used on Huawei devices. In order to use it on any android device, HMS core must be installed first. The app may not work on IOS devices.

The app displays the weather forecast for the next 7 days. 

[Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) was used to fetch the weather info.
